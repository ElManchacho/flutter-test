## Install Flutter

#### 1 - Create a the `src` folder at the root of you disk (with path like `C:\src\`) and open a powershell terminal in it

#### 2 - Run `git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable`

I had an issue with the computer of my company (probably due to security rules) and the clone command were never ending.

#### 2(bis) - If the last cloning command didn't work properly, extract SDK folder in the `src` folder :

You can always download and extract the folder after downloading it here : https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows

Version installed for this test was downloaded here : https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.3.5-stable.zip

#### 3 - Add your newly imported flutter `bin` subfolder repository to your system environnement variables

#### 4 - Restart your VSCode and/or console/terminal (powershell, cmd, etc...)

#### 5 - Run `where.exe flutter dart` to check if the environnement variable is well established

#### 6 - Run `flutter doctor` in the `src` folder to check if all the software dependencies are installed
